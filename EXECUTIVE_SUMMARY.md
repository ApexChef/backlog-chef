# Backlog Chef - Executive Summary

## The Elevator Pitch
**Backlog Chef transforms Scrum refinement meetings into sprint-ready Product Backlog Items with AI-powered quality assurance, risk detection, and stakeholder intelligence.**

Think: *"Grammarly for Agile Requirements"* - but it doesn't just check grammar, it prevents incomplete requirements from entering sprints.

---

## The Problem ($3B Market)

**Every refinement meeting creates 2-3 hours of manual work:**
- Scrum Masters transcribe discussions into tickets
- Missing acceptance criteria discovered mid-sprint
- No historical context ("didn't we discuss this before?")
- Inconsistent quality across teams
- Lost tribal knowledge when people leave

**Real Cost:** 20-30% of sprint capacity wasted on clarification loops.

---

## The Solution

### Not transcription. Intelligence.

**8-Step AI Pipeline:**
1. **Event Detection** - Recognizes meeting type (refinement/planning/retro)
2. **PBI Extraction** - Identifies candidate backlog items from discussions
3. **Confidence Scoring** - Multi-dimensional quality assessment (7 metrics)
4. **Context Enrichment** - Searches similar work, past estimates, lessons learned
5. **Risk Detection** - Flags dependencies, scope creep, missing decisions
6. **Question Generation** - Creates questions WITH proposed answers
7. **Readiness Assessment** - Objective Definition of Ready evaluation
8. **Multi-Format Output** - Publishes to Azure DevOps, Jira, Confluence, Obsidian

### The Differentiators

**🎯 Domain-Specific** - Built for Agile/Scrum, not generic transcription
**🛡️ Quality-First** - Prevents bad requirements (not just extracts them)
**🚀 Actionable** - Proposes solutions, doesn't just identify problems
**🔒 Your Data** - Self-hosted AI option, complete data sovereignty
**🔓 Open Architecture** - Works with ANY tools (not platform-locked)

## Data Sovereignty: The Killer Feature

### Three Deployment Options:

**☁️ CLOUD AI** (Quick Start)
- Managed Claude API
- Fastest setup
- SOC2 compliant

**🔒 SELF-HOSTED AI** (Enterprise)
- On-premise LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen)
- Complete data control
- Air-gapped deployment
- GDPR/SOX/HIPAA compliant

**🔀 HYBRID** (Best of Both)
- Sensitive data → local LLM
- Complex analysis → cloud AI
- Smart routing, cost optimization

### Why This Matters:
- **Financial Services:** Regulatory compliance, zero data exfiltration
- **Manufacturing:** IP protection, trade secrets stay internal
- **Government:** Air-gapped, national security requirements
- **Multinational:** Data residency compliance per region

**Competitors can't offer this.** Fireflies/Otter are cloud-only. Jira AI is locked to Atlassian.
