## Assessment: Solo vs. Partnership Path

### Your Unique Position

**Strong Foundation for Partnership Approach**:
- ✅ Have 2 days/week dedicated time (sustainable pace)
- ✅ High development velocity (AI-augmented)
- ✅ Existing business relationship with potential partner
- ✅ Interest in sales involvement (not just coding)
- ✅ Access to experienced network through Inkubus
- ✅ Wife can support marketing/sales execution

**Partnership Makes More Sense Than Solo Because**:
- You need startup-specific sales/marketing expertise (wife has general experience but not startup context)
- Network access is critical for B2B SaaS - Inkubus provides this immediately
- 2 days/week is perfect for focused development, but not enough for dev + full sales/marketing
- Your strength is technical execution with AI - leverage that, partner for market access

**Phase 3: Execution with Partner**
- [ ] You focus 2 days/week on development
- [ ] Wife supports marketing execution (content, outreach) under Inkubus guidance

## Next Steps Before Pieter Meeting

### Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Review and update market-opportunity.md with target market analysis
- [ ] Create pitch deck highlighting:
  - Problem: Poor PBI quality costs sprints
  - Solution: AI-powered refinement assistant
  - Market: Agile teams in enterprise (overlap with Inkubus clients)
  - Traction: Documentation, architecture, growing backlog
  - Ask: Partnership model, network access, advisory
- [ ] Define 3 partnership models to propose
- [ ] Prepare demo or detailed walkthrough of pipeline
- [ ] List specific portfolio companies that could benefit
- [ ] Clarify what equity/involvement you're open to

### Questions to Ask Pieter
1. Has Inkubus done startup incubation/partnerships before?
2. Which portfolio companies use Agile/Scrum?
3. What's his vision for involvement - hands-on or strategic only?
4. Does he see distribution potential through consultancy network?
5. What metrics/milestones would he want to see for continued support?

## Decision Framework

**Go with Inkubus Partnership IF**:
- ✅ Pieter shows genuine interest and understanding of market
- ✅ Partnership model preserves your product control
- ✅ Network access is real (not just promised)
- ✅ Equity/revenue structure feels fair for value exchange
- ✅ Timeline aligns with your 2-day/week availability

**Consider Alternative IF**:
- ❌ Partnership requires more than 2 days/week commitment
- ❌ Equity ask is too high before product validation
- ❌ Pieter wants to pivot product away from your vision
- ❌ Network access is unclear or limited

## Key Insight

**Your "100% of nothing" risk is significantly reduced by Inkubus partnership**:
- You maintain 80% development focus (your strength)
- Partner handles 80% of sales/marketing strategy (their strength)
- Wife executes marketing tactics under expert guidance
- Built-in customer access through portfolio companies
- Credibility boost from established holding company

**This is likely better than solo because**:
You'd spend 50% time on marketing/sales you're inexperienced with, versus 100% time on development with expert partner handling go-to-market. The math favors partnership here.
