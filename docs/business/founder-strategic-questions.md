# Founder Strategic Questions

**Date**: 2025-11-20
**Context**: Growing backlog of features, approaching decision point on solo vs. partnership approach

## Core Strategic Questions

### 1. Solo Journey vs. Partnership
- **Current State**: Technical vision is clear, product roadmap is growing
- **Key Question**: Can I effectively wear both hats (technical + business development)?
- **Risk**: "100% of nothing is nothing" - building great tech that nobody buys

### 2. Finding the Right Business Partner
- **Need**: Experienced business developer who understands:
  - SaaS go-to-market strategies
  - B2B sales to development teams
  - Product-market fit validation
  - Pricing and positioning
- **Question**: How to find and evaluate potential business co-founders?
- **Question**: What equity/partnership structure makes sense?

### 3. Self-Assessment
**Can I do both marketing and development myself?**

Pros of Solo Approach:
- Full control over vision and execution
- No equity dilution
- Faster decision-making
- Keep all revenue

Cons of Solo Approach:
- Split focus between building and selling
- Marketing/sales expertise gap
- Limited network for customer acquisition
- Slower time to market
- Risk of building in isolation without market validation

### 4. Validation Questions to Answer

Before deciding on approach:
- [ ] Do I have existing network/audience to reach first customers?
- [ ] Do I enjoy sales and marketing activities?
- [ ] Can I dedicate time to customer development while building?
- [ ] Do I have runway (financial + time) to do both?
- [ ] What's my unfair advantage - technical or market access?

## Options to Explore

### Option A: Solo with Advisors
- Stay technical founder + CEO
- Hire fractional CMO or sales consultant
- Join founder communities for peer learning
- Bootstrap and prove concept before seeking partners

### Option B: Find Business Co-Founder
- Seek experienced SaaS business developer
- Look for complementary skills (your tech + their market)
- Split equity based on value creation model
- Accelerate go-to-market

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Build MVP yourself
- Get first 10 paying customers solo (validate product-market fit)
- Then bring in business partner with proof of concept
- Partner enters with clearer value proposition
