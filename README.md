# Backlog Intelligence

**Transform meetings into high-quality Product Backlogs with AI**

## 🎯 Vision
An intelligent system that transforms Scrum meetings into structured, high-quality Product Backlog Items with built-in quality assurance, context enrichment, and stakeholder intelligence.

## 🚀 Key Differentiators
1. **Domain-Specific** - Built for Agile/Scrum workflows
2. **Quality Built-In** - Confidence scoring prevents incomplete requirements
3. **Actionable** - Generates questions, proposals, finds similar work
4. **Integrated** - Works with Fireflies, Jira, DevOps, Confluence
5. **Learning System** - Gets smarter with your history
6. **Provider-Agnostic** - Use any AI platform (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, etc.) with per-task optimization
