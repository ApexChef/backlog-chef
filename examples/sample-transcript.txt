Backlog Refinement Meeting Transcript
Date: January 19, 2025
Duration: 45 minutes
Participants: Sarah (Product Owner), Mike (Tech Lead), Lisa (Developer), John (QA)

Sarah: Okay, let's start with the user authentication improvements. We've had several requests from customers about adding social login options.

Mike: Right, so we're looking at adding Google and Microsoft OAuth support?

Sarah: Exactly. As a user, I want to log in with my Google or Microsoft account so that I don't have to remember another password.

Lisa: That makes sense. For the acceptance criteria, I'd say we need:
- User can click "Sign in with Google" button on login page
- User can click "Sign in with Microsoft" button on login page
- Successful authentication creates user account if it doesn't exist
- Existing users can link their social accounts to current account
- All existing security measures apply to social login users

Mike: We should also consider what happens if the OAuth provider is down. Do we have a fallback?

Sarah: Good point. Let's add that as a technical consideration. The system should show a clear error message if OAuth fails.

John: From a testing perspective, we'll need test accounts for both Google and Microsoft. That could be tricky in our CI/CD pipeline.

Sarah: Noted. Let's make sure we have proper mock services for automated testing.

Sarah: Next item - we need to add export functionality to the dashboard. Users want to export their data to Excel.

Lisa: As a user, I want to export my dashboard data to Excel format so that I can analyze it offline and share with stakeholders.

Mike: What specific data are we talking about? The whole dashboard or specific reports?

Sarah: Good question. Let's start with the main metrics table. Users should be able to click an "Export" button and download an Excel file with all the data currently visible on screen.

Lisa: Acceptance criteria would be:
- Export button is visible on the dashboard
- Clicking export generates an Excel file
- Excel file includes all columns from the dashboard table
- File name includes the date and time of export
- Export preserves the current filter selections

Mike: We need to handle large datasets. What if someone tries to export 10,000 rows?

Sarah: Let's add a limit - say 5,000 rows max. If they have more, show a message suggesting they narrow their filters.

John: I'm concerned about performance. Will this block the UI while generating the file?

Mike: We can make it async. Show a loading spinner and then trigger the download when ready.

Sarah: Last item for today - the search functionality is too slow according to user feedback.

Mike: Yes, I've seen those complaints. Search takes 3-4 seconds for large datasets.

Lisa: As a user, I want search results to appear within 1 second so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for.

Mike: We should add database indexing on the search columns. That's the main bottleneck.

Sarah: What's the scope of work here?

Mike: We'd need to:
1. Add database indexes to name, description, and tags columns
2. Optimize the search query to use those indexes
3. Add caching for common search terms
4. Maybe implement search result pagination

Lisa: That last point about pagination - is that separate work?

Sarah: Let's keep this focused on the performance improvement. We can do pagination as a follow-up if needed.

John: Acceptance criteria:
- Search returns results in under 1 second for datasets up to 10,000 items
- Search accuracy is maintained (no degradation)
- Existing search features still work (wildcards, filters, etc.)

Mike: I estimate this at about 3 story points - it's mostly database work with some query optimization.

Sarah: Sounds good. Let's get these three items refined and ready for next sprint. Great job everyone!
