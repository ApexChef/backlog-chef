# Notes
notes: |
  This is a generic Definition of Ready template.

  Customize this file to match your team's workflow:
  - Add/remove DoR items based on your process
  - Adjust priorities (critical, high, medium, low)
  - Update categories to match your refinement focus

  For a real-world example, see config/salesforce/definition-of-ready.yaml

  DoR Gap Detection:
  - System checks each criterion against the PBI
  - Missing criteria generate "pre_work" refinement tasks
  - Critical priority items block sprint entry
  - High/medium priority items are warnings
