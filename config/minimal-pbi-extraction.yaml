# Minimal PBI Extraction Configuration
#
# This profile contains ONLY the mandatory dependencies required to extract
# user stories (PBIs) from a meeting transcript.
#
# Use this when:
# - You need quick extraction without analysis
# - Cost optimization is critical
# - You'll refine PBIs manually later
# - You want the fastest possible processing

name: minimal-pbi-extraction
description: Extract basic user stories with minimal processing

# Only the absolutely required steps
enabled_steps:
  - detect_event_type    # Step 1: Required to know meeting type
  - extract_candidates   # Step 2: Required to get PBIs from transcript

# All other steps are disabled
disabled_steps:
  - score_confidence     # Optional: Quality scoring
  - enrich_context       # Optional: Historical context
  - check_risks          # Optional: Risk analysis
  - generate_proposals   # Optional: Questions generation
  - readiness_checker    # Optional: Sprint readiness
  - format_output        # Optional: HTML/Markdown output

# What you get with this configuration
output:
  event_type: true          # Meeting type (refinement, planning, etc.)
  total_pbis: true          # Count of extracted PBIs
  pbis:
    - id: true              # PBI-001, PBI-002, etc.
    - title: true           # User story title
    - description: true     # Full description
    - user_persona: true    # Who this is for
    - acceptance_criteria: true  # Success conditions
    - technical_notes: true # Implementation hints

# What you DON'T get (disabled steps)
excluded_output:
  - quality_scores        # From score_confidence
  - completeness_metrics  # From score_confidence
  - similar_work         # From enrich_context
  - past_decisions       # From enrich_context
  - technical_docs       # From enrich_context
  - risk_flags           # From enrich_context
  - risks                # From check_risks
  - questions            # From generate_proposals
  - readiness_assessment # From readiness_checker
  - html_preview         # From format_output

# Performance characteristics
performance:
  estimated_cost_usd: 0.01 - 0.02
  estimated_time_seconds: 5 - 10
  cost_savings_vs_complete: "80-90%"
  time_savings_vs_complete: "95%"

# Dependencies enforced by this configuration
dependencies:
  step_1_detect_event_type:
    depends_on: ["transcript"]
    provides: ["event_type", "confidence"]

  step_2_extract_candidates:
    depends_on: ["event_type"]
    provides: ["candidates", "total_found"]

# Example usage
usage:
  cli: "npm start -- --profile minimal"
  code: |
    const output = await orchestrator.execute(input, {
      steps: {
        only: ['detect_event_type', 'extract_candidates']
      }
    });

# When to upgrade to more complete profiles
upgrade_when:
  - "You need to know PBI quality/completeness"
  - "You want to identify risks or dependencies"
  - "You need sprint-readiness assessment"
  - "You want actionable questions for refinement"
  - "You need beautiful HTML output for stakeholders"
