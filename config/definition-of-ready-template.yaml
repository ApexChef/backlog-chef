# Definition of Ready for Backlog Chef Project
#
# This file defines the criteria that must be met before a PBI can be started.
# When a PBI doesn't meet these criteria, refinement tasks will be generated.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Fill in your team's actual Definition of Ready items below
# 2. For each item, specify:
#    - id: Unique identifier (dor-001, dor-002, etc.)
#    - requirement: What must be present/clear before work starts
#    - verification: How to check if this requirement is met
#    - refinement_task: What task to create if this is missing
#    - priority: How critical is this? (critical, high, medium, low)
#
# Example format:
#
# definition_of_ready:
#   - id: dor-001
#     requirement: "User story follows standard format"
#     verification: "Title contains 'As a... I want... so that...'"
#     refinement_task: "Rewrite user story in standard format with PO"
#     priority: high
#
#   - id: dor-002
#     requirement: "Acceptance criteria are defined"
#     verification: "At least 3 acceptance criteria listed"
#     refinement_task: "Work with PO to define clear acceptance criteria"
#     priority: critical

definition_of_ready:

  # Story Clarity
  - id: dor-001
    requirement: "TODO: Add your story clarity requirement"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify the story is clear?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What should be done to make it clear?"
    priority: high

  # Acceptance Criteria
  - id: dor-002
    requirement: "TODO: Add your acceptance criteria requirement"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify AC are complete?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What task to define AC?"
    priority: critical

  # Dependencies
  - id: dor-003
    requirement: "TODO: Add your dependencies requirement"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify dependencies identified?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What task to identify dependencies?"
    priority: medium

  # Estimation
  - id: dor-004
    requirement: "TODO: Add your estimation requirement"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify effort estimated?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What task to estimate effort?"
    priority: medium

  # Technical Approach
  - id: dor-005
    requirement: "TODO: Add your technical approach requirement"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify approach is clear?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What task to define approach?"
    priority: high

  # Design/UX
  - id: dor-006
    requirement: "TODO: Add your design requirement (if applicable)"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify design is ready?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What task to complete design?"
    priority: medium

  # Test Strategy
  - id: dor-007
    requirement: "TODO: Add your test strategy requirement"
    verification: "TODO: How do you verify test approach defined?"
    refinement_task: "TODO: What task to define test strategy?"
    priority: medium

# ============================================================================
# NOTES:
# ============================================================================
#
# Priority levels:
# - critical: PBI cannot start without this (blocks sprint planning)
# - high: Should be resolved before sprint planning
# - medium: Good to have, but can be refined during sprint
# - low: Nice to have, can be addressed as needed
#
# Common DoR items teams use:
# - Story format and clarity
# - Acceptance criteria defined
# - Dependencies identified
# - Story estimated (story points)
# - Design mockups available
# - Technical approach discussed
# - Performance requirements clear
# - Security considerations identified
# - Test strategy defined
# - No blocking impediments
#
# Refinement tasks will be generated when DoR items are missing.
# These tasks help the team get the PBI to "ready" state.
