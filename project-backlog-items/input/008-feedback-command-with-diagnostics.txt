BACKLOG REFINEMENT MEETING - Feedback Command with Smart Diagnostics
Date: November 20, 2025
Attendees: Product Owner (Alwin), Tech Lead (Claude)

---

Product Owner: I want to make it really easy for users to give us feedback. And when they report problems, I want to automatically gather diagnostic information.

Tech Lead: Like a built-in feedback system? That's smart - lowers the barrier for users to report issues.

Product Owner: Exactly! Instead of making them create a GitHub issue with all the technical details, we handle it for them.

Tech Lead: What would the user experience look like?

Product Owner: Simple command:

```bash
$ backlog-chef feedback
```

Then it asks them questions and optionally gathers logs and diagnostics.

Tech Lead: What kind of feedback are we collecting?

Product Owner: Three main types:
1. **Bug Reports** - Something broke or didn't work
2. **Feature Requests** - Ideas for new features
3. **General Feedback** - Praise, suggestions, UX issues

Tech Lead: And the diagnostics would be contextual based on the feedback type?

Product Owner: Yes! If they report a bug, we ask:
- "Can we include your logs to help debug?"
- "Can we include your config (with API keys redacted)?"
- "Can we include system info (OS, Node version)?"

But if they're just suggesting a feature, we don't need all that.

Tech Lead: I like it. Walk me through the experience for a bug report.

Product Owner:

```bash
$ backlog-chef feedback

Tech Lead: I like how the questions adapt to the feedback type. What about general feedback?

Product Owner: Even simpler - just ask for their thoughts and an optional rating.

Tech Lead: What kind of diagnostic information should we collect?

Product Owner: For bug reports, we should gather:

**System Information:**
- OS and version
- Node.js version
- npm version
- backlog-chef version
- Architecture (arm64, x64)

**Configuration:**
- Which providers are configured (but NOT the API keys!)
- Model configuration
- Output format preferences
- Any custom settings

**Logs:**
- Recent error logs
- Last pipeline run output
- Stack traces if available
- Timestamp of the issue

**Context:**
- Command that was run
- Current working directory (sanitized)
- Input file type (if applicable)
- Output directory structure

Tech Lead: How do we ensure we don't leak sensitive information?

Product Owner: Great question. We need automatic redaction:

**SENSITIVE DATA TO REDACT:**
- API keys (replace with `sk-ant-...redacted`)
- File paths (replace home directory with `~`)
- Email addresses in logs
- Webhook URLs
- Any tokens or credentials

Tech Lead: So we'd have a `SensitiveDataRedactor` class?

Product Owner: Exactly! Something like:

```typescript
class SensitiveDataRedactor {
  redactApiKeys(text: string): string;
  redactFilePaths(text: string): string;
  redactEmails(text: string): string;
  redactUrls(text: string): string;
  redactAll(text: string): string;
}
```

Tech Lead: And users can review everything before submitting?

Product Owner: Yes! Show them exactly what will be sent. Transparency builds trust.

Tech Lead: What about submission methods?

Product Owner: Support multiple options:

**OPTION 1: GitHub Issues (Preferred)**
- Use `gh` CLI to create issue
- Auto-format with template
- Attach diagnostics as code blocks
- Tag appropriately (bug, enhancement, feedback)

**OPTION 2: Feedback API**
- POST to our backend API
- Store in database
- Team reviews in dashboard
- Good for users without GitHub access

**OPTION 3: Local Save**
- Save to `~/.backlog-chef/feedback/`
- User can submit manually
- Good for offline or privacy concerns

Tech Lead: Should we support anonymous feedback?

Product Owner: Yes! Contact info should be optional. Some people just want to report issues without follow-up.

Tech Lead: What about feedback analytics? Should we track patterns?

Product Owner: Good idea! If we use the API, we could:
- Track most common issues
- Identify patterns (e.g., "step 4 fails a lot")
- Measure feedback sentiment
- Prioritize based on frequency

But that's phase 2. Let's start simple.

Tech Lead: Let me draft acceptance criteria:

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

**Core Feedback Command:**
1. User can run `backlog-chef feedback` to start feedback flow
2. System prompts for feedback type (bug, feature, general)
3. Questions adapt based on selected type
4. User can skip optional questions

**Bug Reports:**
5. Ask for issue description, when it happened, what they were doing
6. Offer to collect diagnostics (logs, config, system info)
7. Show preview of what will be submitted
8. All sensitive data automatically redacted

**Feature Requests:**
9. Ask for feature description, problem it solves, priority
10. Optional contact information
11. Link to GitHub discussions for tracking

**General Feedback:**
12. Simple text input with optional rating
13. Thank you message with community links

**Diagnostics:**
14. Collect system info (OS, Node, npm versions)
15. Collect recent logs (configurable number of lines)
16. Collect redacted configuration
17. User can select which diagnostics to include

**Redaction:**
18. Automatically redact API keys (sk-***, ya29.***, etc.)
19. Sanitize file paths (replace home dir with ~)
20. Remove email addresses and URLs if requested
21. Show redacted content before submission for review

**Submission:**
22. Support GitHub Issues via `gh` CLI
23. Support feedback API (if configured)
24. Support local save to file
25. Confirm successful submission with link

**Error Handling:**
26. Handle network failures gracefully
27. Auto-save feedback locally if submission fails
28. Provide retry option
29. Clear error messages

Tech Lead: What about integration with the notification system (when we build it)?

Product Owner: Oh good point! When users report bugs, we could:
- Send notification to our team Slack
- Create a backlog item automatically
- Track in project management tool

But that's future integration. Let's not block on it.

Tech Lead: Risks?

**Risk 1: Users include sensitive data in descriptions**
- Can't auto-redact free text
- Mitigation: Warn users, show preview, provide guidelines

**Risk 2: False positives in redaction**
- Might redact too much, making bug unreproducible
- Mitigation: Show what was redacted, allow manual edit

**Risk 3: GitHub rate limits**
- Too many feedback submissions could hit limits
- Mitigation: Local queue, batch submissions, use API as fallback

**Risk 4: Spam/abuse**
- Malicious users could spam feedback
- Mitigation: Rate limiting, require email verification for API

Product Owner: How do we test this?

Tech Lead:
- Unit tests for redaction logic (test all patterns)
- Integration tests for each submission method
- Mock GitHub CLI for testing issue creation
- Test with real sensitive data to ensure redaction works
- UI tests for interactive prompts

Product Owner: Estimate?

Tech Lead: Breaking it down:
- Feedback command structure: 2 points
- Bug report flow: 2 points
- Feature request flow: 1 point
- Diagnostic collection: 2 points
- Sensitive data redaction: 3 points (critical, needs thorough testing)
- Submission methods: 3 points
- Testing: 2 points

Total: **13-18 story points** (substantial feature)

Product Owner: Dependencies?

Tech Lead:
- OCLIF CLI framework (✅ in PR)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for issue creation (optional)
- Interactive prompt library (we'd use same as setup wizard)
- Need to decide on feedback API architecture

Product Owner: Priority?

Product Owner: MEDIUM. Not blocking, but really valuable for product improvement. Should come after setup guide and before advanced features.

Tech Lead: Future enhancements?

**Phase 2:**
- Feedback dashboard (web UI to browse all feedback)
- Sentiment analysis on feedback
- Auto-categorization using AI
- Integration with product roadmap
- Community voting on feature requests

**Phase 3:**
- In-app feedback (during pipeline execution)
- Screenshot capture for visual issues
- Session replay for debugging
- Feedback templates for common issues

**Phase 4:**
- Feedback gamification (thank contributors)
- Public feedback leaderboard
- Feature request sponsorship
- Beta tester program signup

Product Owner: One more thing - should we have shortcuts for common feedback?

Tech Lead: Like what?

Product Owner: Quick commands like:

```bash
backlog-chef feedback bug "Pipeline failed on step 4"
backlog-chef feedback feature "Add dark mode"
backlog-chef feedback praise "Love this tool!"
```

Skip the interactive flow, submit directly.

Tech Lead: Nice! Power users would love that. We can support both:
- `backlog-chef feedback` - Interactive (recommended)
- `backlog-chef feedback <type> <message>` - Quick mode

Product Owner: Perfect. Alright, summary time!

**SUMMARY:**
- Feature: Feedback Command with Smart Diagnostics
- User Story: As a user, I want an easy way to report bugs and suggest features with automatic diagnostic information, so that the team can quickly understand and fix issues
- Priority: MEDIUM (after setup guide, before advanced features)
- Estimate: 13-18 story points
- Dependencies: CLI framework (✅), Interactive prompts
- Risks: Sensitive data leakage, redaction accuracy, spam

Tech Lead: This is going to give us amazing insights into how people use the tool!

Product Owner: And make it dead simple for users to contribute feedback. Win-win!
