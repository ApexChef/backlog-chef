BACKLOG REFINEMENT MEETING - AI Refinement Sparring Partner
Date: November 20, 2025
Attendees: Product Owner (Alwin), Tech Lead (Claude)

---

Product Owner: I've got an idea that could be really powerful. What if instead of me writing a transcript of a meeting, the AI could HAVE the meeting with me?

Tech Lead: Oh, interesting! Like an interactive refinement session?

Product Owner: Exactly! I start with a rough idea - "I want a PDF preview feature" - and then the AI asks me all the right questions to refine it into a complete PBI.

Tech Lead: So it would be like having a virtual Tech Lead or Business Analyst who knows exactly what questions to ask?

Product Owner: Yes! The AI knows the Definition of Ready checklist, understands software development patterns, and can probe for the missing details.

Tech Lead: And at the end, you'd have a complete transcript that could be fed into the normal pipeline?

Product Owner: Exactly! The output would be a transcript file that looks just like a real refinement meeting, but it was generated through an AI conversation.

Tech Lead: I love this. Let me think about how it would work. What would the user experience be?

Product Owner: I imagine starting with a simple command:
```bash
backlog-chef refine --interactive
```

Then it prompts me:
```
🤖 Backlog Chef Refinement Assistant

Let's refine your Product Backlog Item together.

What feature or story would you like to discuss?
> I want to add a PDF preview modal to my application
```

Tech Lead: And then it starts asking questions?

Product Owner: Right! But smart questions based on what's missing. Like:

```
🤖 Great! A PDF preview modal. Let me help you refine this.

📋 User Story
Can you describe who needs this and why?
(e.g., "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]")
> As a user, I want to preview PDFs without downloading them so that I can quickly check if it's the right document

✅ Good! Now let's define acceptance criteria...

📝 Acceptance Criteria #1
What should happen when the user clicks on a PDF?
> A modal should open showing the PDF content

📝 Acceptance Criteria #2
What if the PDF is very large?
> Show a loading spinner and paginate if needed

📝 Acceptance Criteria #3
How does the user close the modal?
> Click outside the modal, press ESC, or click an X button
```

Tech Lead: So it's guiding you through the Definition of Ready checklist?

Product Owner: Exactly! It knows what questions to ask based on:
1. The Definition of Ready template
2. Common missing elements in PBIs
3. The type of feature being described
4. Your answers so far

Tech Lead: What if you don't know the answer to something?

Product Owner: The AI should be smart about that. It could:
- Offer multiple choice options
- Provide examples from similar features
- Suggest talking to specific stakeholders
- Mark it as "needs follow-up" in the output

Product Owner: And here's the cool part - it should learn from your project context!

Tech Lead: How do you mean?

Product Owner: Well, if your project is a Salesforce app, it asks Salesforce-specific questions. If it's a React app, it asks about components and state management. It reads your docs folder just like the enrichment step does.

Tech Lead: So it's context-aware. That's powerful. What about branching logic in the conversation?

Product Owner: Yes! Like:

```
🤖 Does this feature require backend changes?
> Yes

🤖 Great! Let's discuss the backend requirements...
   - What data needs to be stored?
   - Are there any API endpoints needed?
   - What's the expected data volume?

vs.

> No

🤖 Understood. This is purely frontend. Let's focus on UI/UX...
   - What component library are you using?
   - Any specific design system to follow?
```

Tech Lead: So different question paths based on answers. What about the output format?

Product Owner: At the end, it generates a transcript that looks like a real meeting:

```
BACKLOG REFINEMENT MEETING - PDF Preview Modal Feature
Date: November 20, 2025
Attendees: Product Owner (Alwin), Tech Lead (Backlog Chef AI)

---

Product Owner: I want to add a PDF preview modal to the application.

Tech Lead: Can you describe the user story? Who needs this and why?

Product Owner: As a user, I want to preview PDFs without downloading them so that I can quickly check if it's the right document.

Tech Lead: Excellent. What should happen when a user clicks on a PDF?

Product Owner: A modal should open showing the PDF content.

Tech Lead: And what if the PDF is very large?

[... full conversation continues ...]

SUMMARY:
- Feature: PDF Preview Modal
- User Story: As a user, I want to preview PDFs without downloading...
- Priority: HIGH
- Estimate: 5 story points
- Dependencies: PDF rendering library
```

Tech Lead: And that transcript could then be processed through the normal pipeline?

Product Owner: Exactly! So the workflow would be:
1. Interactive AI refinement session → generates transcript
2. Process transcript through pipeline → generates enriched PBI
3. Review PBI, answer any remaining questions
4. Add to sprint

Tech Lead: What about saving progress? What if you need to stop mid-conversation?

Product Owner: Great point! We should:
- Auto-save the conversation every few exchanges
- Allow resuming with `backlog-chef refine --resume`
- Store drafts in `~/.backlog-chef/drafts/`

Tech Lead: And what if you want to refine an existing PBI?

Product Owner: Oh, good idea! You could:
```bash
backlog-chef refine --existing PBI-001
```

And it would:
1. Read the existing PBI
2. Identify gaps or low-confidence areas
3. Ask targeted questions to fill those gaps
4. Generate an updated transcript

Tech Lead: This is getting really interesting. Let me think about the technical implementation.

**TECHNICAL APPROACH:**

**Phase 1: Question Engine**
- Build a `RefinementQuestionEngine` that:
  - Reads Definition of Ready templates
  - Generates contextual questions based on:
    - Missing DoR criteria
    - Feature type (UI, backend, integration, etc.)
    - Project context from docs
  - Follows conversation flow with branching logic

**Phase 2: Interactive CLI**
- Create `refine` command with interactive mode
- Use a library like `inquirer` or `prompts` for nice CLI UX
- Support different question types:
  - Free text input
  - Multiple choice
  - Yes/No
  - Rating scales

**Phase 3: Conversation Management**
- Save conversation state
- Support resume functionality
- Generate transcript output
- Feed transcript into pipeline

Product Owner: What about the AI model? How does it decide what questions to ask?

Tech Lead: We could use a combination:

**Rule-Based System (Phase 1):**
- Pre-defined question templates based on DoR
- Branching logic based on feature type
- Checklist-driven (like a form with smart defaults)

**AI-Powered System (Phase 2):**
- Use Claude/GPT to dynamically generate questions
- Learn from past refinements
- Adapt to your answering style
- Detect inconsistencies and probe deeper

Product Owner: I like starting with rule-based and evolving to AI-powered. More predictable and testable.

Tech Lead: Agreed. And the rule-based system can be the fallback if AI fails.

Product Owner: What about personas? Can I configure the AI's personality?

Tech Lead: Oh that's fun! We could have refinement "personas":

**Available Personas:**
1. **"Thorough Analyst"** - Asks lots of detailed questions
2. **"Agile Coach"** - Focuses on user stories and value
3. **"Technical Architect"** - Digs into implementation details
4. **"Minimalist"** - Only essential questions
5. **"Your Custom Persona"** - Train it on your style

Product Owner: I love that! Different teams have different refinement styles.

Tech Lead: We could even support multi-persona mode where it switches based on the question type.

Product Owner: Let's not get too fancy in v1. Start simple - one persona, rule-based questions.

Tech Lead: Fair. Let me draft acceptance criteria.

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

1. User can start interactive refinement with `backlog-chef refine --interactive`
2. System asks questions based on Definition of Ready template
3. Questions adapt based on feature type (UI, backend, integration)
4. User can skip questions or mark as "needs follow-up"
5. Conversation auto-saves every 5 exchanges
6. User can resume with `backlog-chef refine --resume`
7. System generates transcript in standard format
8. Transcript can be processed through normal pipeline
9. Output includes conversation metadata (duration, completion %)
10. User can exit at any time with `Ctrl+C` (saves draft)

Product Owner: Perfect. What about risks?

Tech Lead: A few concerns:

**Risk 1: Conversation gets too long**
- Mitigation: Set maximum questions (e.g., 20), allow user to skip

**Risk 2: Questions feel robotic**
- Mitigation: Use natural language, vary phrasing, show context

**Risk 3: User answers don't fit expected format**
- Mitigation: AI-powered parsing, clarification questions, examples

**Risk 4: Lost progress if crash**
- Mitigation: Auto-save frequently, store in temp location

Product Owner: How do we test this?

Tech Lead:
- Unit tests for question engine logic
- Mock conversations with predefined answers
- Integration tests that generate full transcripts
- Manual testing with real feature ideas

Product Owner: Estimate?

Tech Lead: This is more complex. I'd say 8-13 story points. Breaking it down:
- Question engine: 3 points
- Interactive CLI: 3 points
- Save/resume: 2 points
- Transcript generation: 2 points
- Testing and polish: 3 points

Product Owner: Dependencies?

Tech Lead:
- Need a good CLI interaction library (inquirer, prompts)
- Might want to add conversation state management
- Should integrate with existing DoR templates

Product Owner: Future enhancements?

Tech Lead: So many possibilities!

**Phase 2:**
- AI-powered question generation (not just rule-based)
- Support for images/screenshots in conversation
- Voice input option
- Multiple participants (team refinement)

**Phase 3:**
- Learn from past refinements (suggest similar stories)
- Detect duplicate/similar features
- Auto-estimate based on past work
- Generate implementation tasks during conversation

**Phase 4:**
- Web interface (not just CLI)
- Real-time collaboration (multiple people refining together)
- Video call integration (join Zoom, ask questions during meeting)
- Integration with project management tools

Product Owner: This could be huge. It basically makes the refinement meeting optional - you have a conversation with AI instead.

Tech Lead: Or augments the meeting. Imagine:
1. Team discusses feature vaguely
2. Run AI refinement to fill gaps
3. Review AI-generated PBI in next standup
4. Approve and add to sprint

Product Owner: Love it. One more question - should this work offline?

Tech Lead: Good question. The rule-based version could work offline (just templates and logic). The AI-powered version needs API access. We should support both modes.

Product Owner: Perfect. Let's add this to the backlog!

Tech Lead: Summary time?

Product Owner: Yes!

**SUMMARY:**
- Feature: AI Refinement Sparring Partner
- User Story: As a Product Owner, I want to have an interactive refinement conversation with an AI assistant, so that I can quickly transform rough ideas into complete PBIs without needing a full team meeting
- Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH (after CLI and notifications are solid)
- Estimate: 8-13 story points
- Dependencies: CLI framework (already done), DoR templates (need to standardize)
- Risks: Conversation UX, response parsing, state management

Tech Lead: This is going to change how teams do refinement. Instead of:
"Wait for next refinement meeting" → "Have a 10-minute AI conversation"

Product Owner: Exactly. Democratizes refinement. Anyone can do it, anytime.

Tech Lead: I'm excited to build this. Should we prototype it?

Product Owner: Let's get notifications done first, then we can experiment with this. But I love the vision.

## Questions for Product Owner

1. Should the AI remember past conversations to get better at asking questions?
2. Do you want to support multiple languages (not just English)?
3. Should there be a "quick mode" with fewer questions for small stories?
4. What if someone wants to refine multiple related stories in one session?
5. Should the AI suggest breaking down large features into smaller stories?
