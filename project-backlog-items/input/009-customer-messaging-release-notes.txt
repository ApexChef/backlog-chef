BACKLOG REFINEMENT MEETING - Customer Messaging & Release Notes
Date: November 20, 2025
Attendees: Product Owner (Alwin), Tech Lead (Claude)

---

Product Owner: I have an idea for another feature - we need a way to push messages to our customers. Like a chat window or push notifications with release notes.

Tech Lead: Interesting! So this is the opposite direction from the feedback command (PBI-008). That one lets users send feedback TO us, and this one pushes information FROM us TO users?

Product Owner: Exactly! I want to be able to announce new features, share release notes, notify about breaking changes, or even just send helpful tips.

Tech Lead: Where would these messages appear?

Product Owner: A few ideas:
1. **In-CLI notifications** - When they run any command, show a dismissible message
2. **Release notes command** - `backlog-chef releases` shows recent updates
3. **Chat/help window** - Interactive help system (future)
4. **Email notifications** - For major releases (opt-in)

Tech Lead: Let's start with the simplest - in-CLI notifications. Like how npm or brew show update messages?

Product Owner: Yes! Something like:

```bash
$ backlog-chef process meeting.txt

📢 New in v0.3.0:
   • Setup wizard now auto-detects missing config
   • Added feedback command for bug reports
   • Improved error messages

   Run 'backlog-chef releases' to see full changelog
   Dismiss: Use --no-messages flag

Tech Lead: How do we deliver these messages? Where are they stored?

Product Owner: Good question. A few approaches:

**OPTION 1: Remote Message Service**
- Host a simple API endpoint
- CLI checks for messages on startup
- Messages stored in database
- We control content in real-time

**OPTION 2: Package-based Messages**
- Include messages in package.json or a messages.json file
- Updated with each npm release
- No API calls needed
- Simple but less flexible

**OPTION 3: GitHub Releases**
- Fetch from GitHub releases API
- Parse release notes automatically
- Free, no infrastructure needed
- Good for open source projects

Tech Lead: I like Option 3 for MVP - it's simple and leverages GitHub. We can add a remote service later for more dynamic messages.

Product Owner: Agreed. So the flow would be:
1. CLI checks GitHub releases API
2. Compares current version with latest release
3. Shows release notes if user is behind
4. Caches response to avoid rate limits

Tech Lead: What about message types?

Product Owner: I'm thinking:

**MESSAGE TYPES:**
1. **Release Notes** - What's new in latest version
2. **Breaking Changes** - Urgent updates needed
3. **Tips & Tricks** - Helpful usage suggestions
4. **Announcements** - Community news, events
5. **Deprecation Warnings** - Feature removal notices

Tech Lead: Should users be able to control which messages they see?

Product Owner: Absolutely! Add configuration options:

```yaml
# ~/.backlog-chef/config.yaml
messages:
  enabled: true
  types:
    release_notes: true
    breaking_changes: true
    tips: true
    announcements: false
    deprecations: true
  frequency: "daily"  # daily, weekly, never
```

Tech Lead: What about the `backlog-chef releases` command?

Product Owner: It should show a nicely formatted list of recent releases:

```bash
$ backlog-chef releases

```

Tech Lead: That's beautiful! What about update prompts? Should we notify when a new version is available?

Product Owner: Yes, but not too pushy. Show a gentle reminder:

```bash
$ backlog-chef process meeting.txt

💡 A new version is available: v0.4.0 (you have v0.3.0)
   Run 'npm update -g backlog-chef' to upgrade
   Release notes: backlog-chef releases

   Dismiss for 7 days: backlog-chef config set update_check.dismiss=true
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```

Tech Lead: What about caching? We don't want to hit GitHub API on every command.

Product Owner: Good point. Let's cache intelligently:
- Check for updates once per day (configurable)
- Store last check timestamp in `~/.backlog-chef/cache/last_update_check`
- Cache release notes for 24 hours
- Respect GitHub rate limits (60 requests/hour unauthenticated)

Tech Lead: What about in-app tips? You mentioned helpful suggestions?

Product Owner: Yes! Context-aware tips based on usage patterns:

```bash
$ backlog-chef process meeting.txt

💡 Tip: You can use the --verbose flag to see detailed pipeline logs
   Example: backlog-chef process meeting.txt --verbose
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Or:

```bash
$ backlog-chef process meeting.txt

💡 Tip: Processing a lot of transcripts? Try the interactive refinement mode!
   Run: backlog-chef refine --interactive
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Tech Lead: How do we decide which tips to show?

Product Owner: Track user behavior:
- If they've run `process` 10+ times → suggest `refine --interactive`
- If they never use `--verbose` → suggest it for debugging
- If they haven't set up notifications → suggest PBI-005 feature
- If config is local only → suggest global config

Tech Lead: Let me draft acceptance criteria:

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**

**Release Notes Command:**
1. `backlog-chef releases` shows formatted list of recent releases
2. Release data fetched from GitHub Releases API
3. Current version is highlighted
4. Each release shows features, bug fixes, breaking changes
5. Link to full changelog on GitHub

**In-CLI Notifications:**
6. New releases are announced on next CLI run
7. Messages are dismissible with `--no-messages` flag
8. Messages cached for 24 hours to avoid API spam
9. Last update check timestamp stored locally
10. Update check frequency is configurable

**Message Types:**
11. Support release notes, breaking changes, tips, announcements, deprecations
12. Users can enable/disable message types in config
13. Tips are context-aware based on usage patterns
14. Breaking changes are always shown (can't be disabled)

**Configuration:**
15. Messages configurable via `~/.backlog-chef/config.yaml`
16. Can set frequency (daily, weekly, never)
17. Can dismiss specific messages for N days
18. Can disable all non-critical messages

**Caching & Performance:**
19. GitHub API calls cached for 24 hours
20. Respects GitHub rate limits
21. Fails gracefully if API unavailable (offline mode)
22. No performance impact on CLI startup (async check)

**Update Notifications:**
23. Notify when new version available
24. Show upgrade command (`npm update -g backlog-chef`)
25. Link to release notes
26. Can be dismissed for 7 days

Tech Lead: What about privacy? Are we tracking any user data?

Product Owner: Good question. We should be transparent:
- We DON'T track personal information
- We DON'T send analytics to external services
- We only fetch public release data from GitHub
- All behavior tracking is LOCAL ONLY (stored in `~/.backlog-chef/`)

Tech Lead: Should we have a `backlog-chef messages` command to manage messages?

Product Owner: Great idea! Something like:

```bash
$ backlog-chef messages

📨 Message Management
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Settings:
  • Messages enabled: Yes
  • Update checks: Daily
  • Last check: 2 hours ago

Message Types:
  ✓ Release notes
  ✓ Breaking changes
  ✓ Tips & tricks
  ✗ Announcements (disabled)
  ✓ Deprecations

Recent Messages (last 7 days):
  1. New version available: v0.4.0 (dismissed)
  2. Tip: Use --verbose for debugging
  3. Breaking change: .env format updated

Commands:
  backlog-chef messages clear       Clear all dismissed messages
  backlog-chef messages disable     Disable all messages
  backlog-chef messages enable      Enable messages
  backlog-chef messages check       Manually check for updates
```

Tech Lead: What about internationalization? Messages in different languages?

Product Owner: Let's defer that to Phase 2. Start with English only, but design the message format to support i18n later.

Tech Lead: Risks?

Product Owner: A few concerns:

**Risk 1: GitHub API rate limits**
- We're limited to 60 requests/hour unauthenticated
- Mitigation: Cache aggressively, only check once per day

**Risk 2: Message spam**
- Too many messages annoy users
- Mitigation: Configurable frequency, dismissible, respect user preferences

**Risk 3: Offline usage**
- CLI should work without internet
- Mitigation: Graceful fallback, cached data, never block on API calls

**Risk 4: Message fatigue**
- Users ignore all messages if too frequent
- Mitigation: Only show important updates, context-aware tips

Tech Lead: Estimate?

Product Owner: Breaking it down:
- GitHub API integration: 2 points
- `releases` command: 2 points
- In-CLI notifications: 2 points
- Message management: 2 points
- Caching & configuration: 2 points
- Tips system: 3 points
- Testing: 2 points

Total: **13-18 story points** (substantial feature)

Tech Lead: Dependencies?

Product Owner: We need:
- CLI framework (✅ in PR)
- Configuration management (from PBI-007)
- GitHub API client library
- Caching mechanism

Tech Lead: Priority?

Product Owner: MEDIUM. Not blocking, but important for user engagement and keeping users informed. Should come after setup wizard (PBI-007) but before advanced features.

Tech Lead: Future enhancements?

**Phase 2:**
- Remote message service (not just GitHub)
- In-app chat/help window
- Message analytics (which tips are helpful?)
- Community-contributed tips
- Internationalization (i18n)

**Phase 3:**
- Interactive tutorials
- Onboarding walkthrough
- Video tips and guides
- Integration with documentation

**Phase 4:**
- Community forum integration
- User-to-user messaging
- Feature voting
- Beta program announcements

Product Owner: Summary time!

**SUMMARY:**
- Feature: Customer Messaging & Release Notes
- User Story: As a Backlog Chef user, I want to stay informed about new features and updates, so that I can take advantage of improvements and avoid breaking changes
- Priority: MEDIUM (after setup wizard, before advanced features)
- Estimate: 13-18 story points
- Dependencies: CLI framework (✅), configuration management (PBI-007)
- Risks: API rate limits, message spam, offline usage

Tech Lead: One more thing - should messages have a severity level?

Product Owner: Good idea! Something like:

**SEVERITY LEVELS:**
- **CRITICAL** - Breaking changes, security issues (always shown)
- **HIGH** - Major new features, important updates
- **MEDIUM** - Minor features, tips
- **LOW** - Announcements, community news

Users can filter by minimum severity level.

Tech Lead: Perfect. This will help users stay engaged and informed!

Product Owner: Exactly. And it gives us a direct communication channel without being intrusive.

## Questions for Product Owner

1. Should we show messages on every command or only on certain commands?
2. What's the maximum number of messages to show at once?
3. Should critical messages block command execution until acknowledged?
4. Do you want message read receipts (track which users saw which messages)?
5. Should messages be stored locally after being dismissed?
6. What format should we use for markdown in messages (for links, formatting)?
