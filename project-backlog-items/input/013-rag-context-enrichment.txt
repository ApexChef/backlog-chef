Meeting: Backlog Refinement Session
Date: November 21, 2025
Participants: Product Owner, Technical Lead

Product Owner: "I've been thinking about how we can improve Step 4 - the 'Enrich with Context' step. Right now, it's using mock data or basic searches, but we need real, intelligent retrieval of similar work, past decisions, and technical documentation."

Technical Lead: "Absolutely. I actually came across this article about building RAG systems: https://www.kdnuggets.com/7-steps-to-build-a-simple-rag-system-from-scratch. It outlines a straightforward approach."

Product Owner: "Perfect! So the idea is to set up a RAG system that we can use to lookup data when we want to enrich content during Step 4. This would replace the current placeholder logic."

Technical Lead: "Right. We'd need to:
1. Create a vector database of our historical PBIs, decisions, and documentation
2. Implement semantic search to find relevant context
3. Integrate this into the existing Step 4 pipeline
4. Make it configurable so users can point it at their own knowledge bases"

Product Owner: "What about the data sources? We should support multiple types of knowledge bases."

Technical Lead: "Good point. We should support:
- Previous PBI JSON files from past pipeline runs
- Markdown documentation files
- Confluence pages (via API)
- Azure DevOps work items (via API)
- Custom JSON/YAML files for decisions and ADRs"

Product Owner: "And this needs to work locally without requiring external services, right?"

Technical Lead: "Yes, we can use local embedding models like sentence-transformers or all-MiniLM, and a local vector store like Chroma or FAISS. But we should also support cloud options like Pinecone or Weaviate for teams that want better performance."

Product Owner: "What about the acceptance criteria?"

Technical Lead: "Let me outline them:
1. Vector database setup with configurable storage (local or cloud)
2. Document ingestion pipeline for multiple source types
3. Semantic search returns top-k relevant documents with similarity scores
4. Integration with Step 4 replaces mock data with real RAG results
5. CLI commands for indexing documents and managing the vector store
6. Configuration file for data sources, embedding model, and vector store
7. Proper error handling when vector store is not initialized
8. Performance: search queries complete in < 500ms for local, < 2s for cloud"

Product Owner: "This will be a game-changer. The similar work detection will actually be useful instead of just returning mock examples."

Technical Lead: "Agreed. We should also think about the update strategy - how often do we re-index? Do we support incremental updates?"

Product Owner: "Good questions. Let's add those to the technical considerations. We should support both full re-index and incremental updates."

Technical Lead: "I'll also note that we need to handle embeddings for different content types differently - code snippets need different treatment than markdown prose."

Product Owner: "Makes sense. And we should track which documents were retrieved for each enrichment, so users can audit the RAG's suggestions."

Technical Lead: "That's a great point for transparency. We can add that to the context enrichment output."

Product Owner: "Alright, I think we have enough to create this PBI. This builds on the template system we just finished, and will make Step 4 actually intelligent."

Technical Lead: "Agreed. This is definitely a high-priority item since it affects the core value proposition - turning transcripts into well-informed PBIs."
